## Summary
 I enjoyed this project and learned a lot, I found it frustrating in the beginning because I had to go to Google a lot and had no idea how to use StackOverflow.

When I started the analysis, I knew nothing about football (zilch) or how world cup tournaments were held. But took help from Google helped me understand the rules of football and how teams qualified for the World Cup

This dataset contains all World Cup matches and players from 1930-2014. I wanted to draw insights from this data, and thankfully, Maven Analytics suggested questions that would allow me to do that.

## Data

[World Cup Matches] 
[World Cup Players] 
[World Cup Preview]

## Key Insights

This dataset explored many questions namely:

*How has attendance trended over time? (both average per game and total per year)

*Do certain cities tend to draw bigger crowds?

*Do certain teams see larger attendance?

*Which teams have won the most games? How has number of wins by country trended over time?

*Based on the Home Team and Away Team columns, does there seem to be a "home team advantage"?

*Do any teams seem to be stronger in either the first half or the second half? (think about both offense and defense)
